    <section>
      <p class="fs-1 font-monospace" >Hi,
      
      My name is Thapanakorn and I am a driven and ambitious individual with a passion for creativity and problem-solving. I have
      always been fascinated by the world of technology and its ability to transform and improve the way we live and work.
      </p><p>
      I have a strong educational background in computer science, where I learned various programming languages and acquired
      problem-solving skills. I have also taken additional courses in graphic design, which have honed my creative abilities
      and eye for detail.
      </p><p>
      In my previous role as a software developer intern, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, contributing
      to the development and implementation of innovative solutions. This experience has equipped me with strong technical
      skills and the ability to work effectively in a team environment.
      </p><p>
      In addition to my technical skills, I am also an effective communicator and have demonstrated the ability to translate
      complex technical concepts into simple and understandable language for non-technical stakeholders. I thrive in
      fast-paced environments and have a strong work ethic, always striving for excellence in everything I do.
      </p><p>
      Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading books on personal development, and honing my skills in
      graphic design. I am also an avid photographer and love capturing beautiful moments in nature and urban environments.
      </p><p>
      Overall, I am a motivated and dedicated individual who is passionate about using my technical and creative skills to
      contribute to meaningful projects. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and am eager to continue
      expanding my knowledge and skills in the field of technology.</p>
